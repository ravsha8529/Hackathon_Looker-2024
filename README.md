# Find Your Car!

We've created a dashboard that helps users decide on a used car to purchase based on their preferences and a database of top-rated used cars. Simply select a car you like, and our dashboard will recommend a list of 10 similar cars that match your preferences!

Our methodology leverages a recommendation system that uses advanced data processing techniques to analyze key attributes such as year, mileage, price, fuel type, safety ratings, and more. By comparing these features, we identify cars that align closely with your chosen vehicle, ensuring recommendations tailored to your needs.
